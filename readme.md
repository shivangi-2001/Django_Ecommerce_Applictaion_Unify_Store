# Project Overview

**_UnifyStore_** is a robust Django e-commerce application designed to serve as a 
**boilerplate** and foundation for building scalable online stores. 
It provides core **_e-commerce functionalities_**, allowing developers to extend 
and customize the platform to meet specific user needs. 
The codebase is well-structured with clear comments, making it easy to 
understand and maintain, even for developers who are new to the project.

## Features

- **Authorization & Authentication:** Includes secure user registration, login, and logout.

- **Email OTP Verification:** Adds a layer of security by verifying user accounts with a one-time password sent via email.

- **Shopping Cart:** A fully functional system for adding, removing, and updating products before checkout.

- **Wishlist:** Allows users to save products they are interested in for future purchase.

## Future Goals

This project is built to be a **springboard** for further development. 
The following features are planned for future implementation:

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrating secure payment solutions like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Advanced Functionality:** Adding features such as a user review system, product recommendations, or an admin dashboard.

# üîê Authentication & Authorization

## User Management

This project implements a **secure authentication system** using **Django**, **Django OTP**, and **custom logic for account verification**.

The flow ensures that only verified users can log in, while protecting against brute force OTP attempts.

### 1. User Registration

* A new user registers with **email, first name, and last name**. 
* The account is created with `is_active = False` (inactive until verified). 
* An **EmailDevice** is created using **django-otp**, which generates and sends a **One-Time Password (OTP)** to the registered email. 
* The user is redirected to the **OTP Verification** page.

### 2. OTP Verification

+ The user must enter the received OTP to activate the account. 
+ OTP is verified using `device.verify_token()`.

#### Valid OTP:

+ The user account is activated (`is_active = True`). 
+ OTP attempts reset to `3`
+ The user can now log in.

#### Invalid OTP:

* The `otp_attempts` counter decreases by 1. 
* After **3 failed attempts**, the account is locked:
  * reset_timer is set for **30 minutes**. 
  * During this period, the user cannot request OTP or log in.

### 3. Lockout & Retry

* If the user is locked (`reset_timer set`):
  * Any OTP verification or resend attempts will be blocked with an error message until the timer expires.

* After **30 minutes**:
  * The lock is lifted automatically. 
  * `otp_attempts` reset to 3. 
  * The user can request a fresh OTP again.

### 4. Resend OTP (VerifyAccount flow)

* Users can request a **new OTP** if:
  * Their account is not verified yet. 
  * They are not currently locked (`reset_timer` expired).

* To prevent spamming, a new OTP can only be sent every **2 minutes.**
* Once conditions are met, a fresh OTP is generated and emailed.

### 5. Login

* Login is handled via Django‚Äôs built-in `LoginView`. 
* Only **active and verified users** (`is_active=True`) can log in. 
* On success, the user is redirected to the homepage/dashboard. 
* On failure (invalid credentials or inactive account), an error message is shown.

## Authorization

- **Authenticated users** can access their **Profile** and other protected pages.
- **Unauthenticated or inactive users** are always redirected to the login/OTP verification pages. 
- Fine-grained permissions can be extended via Django‚Äôs `PermissionsMixin`.

## Security

This project is designed with layered security to prevent brute-force, replay, and abuse of OTP.

#### OTP-based Account Activation

   * Users must confirm their email with an OTP sent via `django-otp`. 
   * Ensures only verified emails can log in.

#### Automatic Lockout after Failed OTP Attempts 

   * Each user has `otp_attempts = 3`. 
   * After 3 failed tries ‚Üí account is **locked for 30 minutes**. 
   * Prevents brute-force attacks on OTP codes.

#### Timed Lock Expiry

   * Lock (`reset_timer`) automatically expires after 30 minutes. 
   * User can retry registration/verification after cooldown.

#### Resend OTP Cooldown

   * New OTP can only be requested every **2 minutes**. 
   * Prevents spamming & email abuse.

#### Session-Based Authentication

   * Once verified, users authenticate with Django‚Äôs session system. 
   * Ensures secure state management for logged-in users.
